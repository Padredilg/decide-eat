## Description 

Decide Eat was crafted to offer a unique experience on date night in. This app will elevate your date night by bringing the fun to the comfort of your home. Remove the stress of deciding by taking our quiz that pairs you with a recipe, cocktail, and music playlist recommendation.


In the future we would like to include a way for users to be able to favorite/save specific recipes and have them added to their favorites list. We would also like to include a way to be able to share your quiz results on social media.
